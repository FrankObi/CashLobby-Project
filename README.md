# CashLobby-Project
**CashLobby was a site that I created in 2012**

These are the files for a website I finished creating on January 2012. 

I wrote the entire site myself in php, html, and javascript(jquery).
The website was to be a paid per download site, meaning a user gets paid for each download they received. 
I admit, this idea was very ambitious for my age at the time and was done by a few companies.

It took me four months to write all this code.
The front page of the website looks like this.

Including the home page above, the website had a page for registering a new user and pages that only logged in users could access for example a user's uploads.
A user can always tell when they are logged in or not because every page had a navigatin list that gave them different options if they were logged in.
They would also see their username at the top right conner of the page if they were logged in.

Note: this code does not include the sql code for the database
