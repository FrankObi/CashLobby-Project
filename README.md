# CashLobby-Project
CashLobby was a site that I created in 2012

This are the files for a website I finished creating on January 2012. 

I wrote the entire site myself in php, html, and javascript(jquery). T
he website was supposed to be a paid per download site, meaning a user gets paid for each download they received. 
I admit, this idea was very ambitious for my age at the time and was done by a few companies.

It took me many months especially since I was just learning javascript when I has started.

The front page of the website looked like this back in 2012 and should still look like that.

The site had a page for registering a new user and pages that only uses could access for example a user's uploads.
A user can always tell when they are logged in or not because every page had a list that gave them the option to log out if they were logged in.
They would also see their username at the top right conner of the page if they were logged in.

Note: this code does not include the sql code for the database
